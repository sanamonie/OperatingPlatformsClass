Final document for operating platforms class

The Following is the required prompts for the final Journal entry

   Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 

    --The Gaming room client is a game run server side that allows multiple users to join to a single game sessions hosted server side that allows them to participate and play in a word based game. The included document describes the recommended course of action needed to expand the game and service to different operating platforms. 

    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 

    ---One thing that I think i did particularly well is concisely recommending a platform and explain why that choose was a correct one for the company. 

    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 

    ---When looking at the design document it allowed me to get a bigger picture understanding of exactly was needed to develop the necessary software and create a minimal viable product to showcase. 

    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

    --- The part in my document i would choose to revise would most likely be the operating system constraints. I would expand more on the necessary measures that would be needed for each operating  

        system to properly run the client software. 

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

    --When interpreting the user needs and applying them to the software I focused on the what type of software would cater to the customers exact needs in order to create a product that could be quickly shown and modified. 

    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 

    ---when designing software its crucial to use a combination of known practices and patterns and personal ingenuity in order to create clever solutions that solve the customers problem fast an efficiently. When Creating           the software reveling around the design document, I utilized learned java patterns to quickly set up authentication systems for users and game masters.
